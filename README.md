# FAIR Data Point Deployment Example

This is an example deployment of the FAIR Data Point using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). You can clone the repository and run it with:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

We recommend reading the [Installation](https://fairdatapoint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/installation.html) and [Configuration](https://fairdatapoint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/configuration.html) chapters in the documentation. After starting the FDP, you can log in using [Default User Accounts](https://fairdatapoint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/installation.html#default-users).
